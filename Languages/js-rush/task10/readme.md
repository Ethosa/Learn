# Primitive Pythagorean Triples

A Pythagorean triple is a set of three integer numbers that form a right triangle. The sum of the squares of the two smaller numbers should equal the square of the largest number. Given three numbers a, b and c (c being the largest):
```
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
```

Furthermore, a Pythagorean triple is said to be primitive if the three numbers are pairwise coprime — that is, the greatest common prime factor between any two numbers is 1.

Create a function that takes an array of three numbers (unordered) and returns `true` if the numbers constitute a primitive Pythagorean triple, `false` otherwise.

### Examples
```js
isPrimPythTriple([4, 5, 3]) ➞ true
isPrimPythTriple([7, 12, 13]) ➞ false
isPrimPythTriple([39, 15, 36]) ➞ false
// Pythagorean triple, but not primitive.
isPrimPythTriple([77, 36, 85]) ➞ true
```
